# Movie-Trailer-Website-Project-1
This contains a server-side code to store a list of movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. Then this code is used to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.

# Directory Structure
- media.py has the code to create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster    URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

- entertainment_center.py has the code to create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent my favorite movies and code to group all the instances together in a list.

- fresh_tomatoes.py has the code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers. 

# To run the code
- Install [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/).
- Clone this repository.
- Open entertainment_center.py file and run it.
